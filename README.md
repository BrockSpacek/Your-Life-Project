Project Your Life
Description: Made a website about my life, accomplishments and interests with different pages for each section and the ability to go between them

Peer Review - Michael Heckerman
Comments- Code looks good for where we are at in the level. Site looks pretty simaliar to the figma. I did notice that the background shifts a bit when going to or leaving the home page. Other then that looking good.
